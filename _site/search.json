Prof. Antoniade-Ciprian ALEXANDRU-CARAGEA PhD\nEcological University of Bucharest\nCiprian ALEXANDRU PhD., Associate Professor at the Ecological University of Bucharest and was previously appointed as Vice-rector on Research activities. He was invited as Keynote speaker with the topic “Reproducible Research with R”, in 2015, to the International Conference on Computing, Mathematics and Statistics (iCMS2015) Malaysia.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a trainer of National Institute of Statistics, he worked with various private clients, like telecom and banking industries, but also with public institutions, into training on the job system, starting from understanding their data and the business itself, identifying their needs for analyzing the data, to building models. Training activities held in National Centre for Training in Statistics from Bucharest: “Data Analysis in Statistics with R”; “The course Introduction to Statistics - Applications in R”; “R Statistical Software – Presenting Advantages of its use for Data Analysis”; “Statistical Analysis – from Theory to Practice”; “Concepts, Models and Techniques for Data Analysis” http://r-project.ro/training.html. He worked as a trainer for EUROSTAT and UNDP.\n\nHe participated in various research projects (including Eurostat), workshops, national and international conferences. His research activity was commissioned in value by publishing studies in journals in Romania and in Europe, as well as in international databases (ISI Thomson, DOAJ, EBSCO, RePEc. His research papers and articles are also published in prestigious peer-reviewed publications. \n\nPlenary\nAssoc. Prof. Antoniade-Ciprian ALEXANDRU-CARAGEA PhD will be presenting on ‘AI as an Accelerator and Common Language for Scientist’ on 21th August 2025 during the 6th International Conference on Computing, Mathematics and Statistics 2025 (iCMS2025).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynopsis\n\n\n\nIn today’s rapidly evolving landscape of scientific discovery, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative force, serving both as a powerful accelerator and a unifying language across scientific disciplines. Much like how the advent of informatics and the adoption of the English language have historically propelled global collaboration and innovation, AI now offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance research efficiency, unlock new insights, and foster cross-disciplinary communication.\n\nThis presentation explores the role of AI in driving advancements in fields ranging from biology to astrophysics, as well as its ability to standardize methodologies and practices across traditionally siloed areas of study. By leveraging AI, scientists are equipped to process vast datasets, model complex systems, and simulate phenomena that were previously impossible to comprehend. Additionally, AI’s capacity to provide shared tools and frameworks creates a universal platform for collaboration, akin to the role that mathematics and standardized measurement systems have played in the past.\n\nDrawing on historical parallels with other technological accelerators like the printing press, informatics, and the internet, this talk will highlight how AI is not just a tool but a new kind of scientific language that can bridge disciplines, enhance collaboration, and accelerate innovation at an unprecedented pace. Attendees will gain insights into the transformative potential of AI and the critical role it will play in shaping the future of science and research.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlenary Speaker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nTs. Inv. Dr. Wan Azani Bin Wan Mustafa\nSenior Lecturer\nFaculty of Electrical Engineering Technology\nUniversiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP)\n\n\n\nDr. Wan Azani Bin Wan Mustafa, a senior lecturer at Universiti Malaysia Perlis, specializes in mechatronic engineering, with a Ph.D. focused on image luminosity and contrast enhancement. His expertise includes artificial intelligence, IoT, robotics, and computer programming. As Editor-in-Chief for two journals and a visiting professor at Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta, Dr. Azani has contributed to over 390 papers with substantial citations. His work also includes numerous patents and grants, such as projects on intelligent systems for breast cancer detection and IoT-based water quality monitoring.\n\nBeyond academia, Dr. Azani is affiliated with multiple prestigious organizations, such as the IEEE (Senior Member), the International Federation of Inventors’ Association, and the Asian Council of Science Editors. His leadership and professional affiliations underscore his global recognition and commitment to excellence within engineering and research communities. As a recognized leader in his field, Dr. Azani actively contributes to advancing Malaysia’s engineering sector, embodying a blend of academic prowess, innovative research, and a dedication to impactful technological solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlenary\nTs. Inv. Dr. Wan Azani Bin Wan Mustafa will be presenting on ‘Healthcare Research: The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Modern Medicine’ on 21 January 2025 during the 6th International Conference on Computing, Mathematics and Statistics 2025 (iCMS2025).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynopsis\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has transformed healthcare research and is rapidly reshaping modern medicine by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, predicting treatment outcomes, and supporting personalized patient care. This speech explores the key applications of AI in healthcare, such as its use in medical imaging for early disease detection, predictive analytics for patient monitoring, and decision support systems that aid clinicians in making more informed treatment choices. Additionally, it will address the ethical considerations and challenges faced in integrating AI into healthcare, including data privacy, bias, and the importance of human oversight. Attendees will gain insights into how AI is advancing medical research and paving the way for a more efficient, accurate, and patient-centered healthcare system. This talk aims to highlight the significant, yet balanced, role that AI plays in augmenting—not replacing—the expertise and compassion of healthcare professionals in delivering better patient outcomes."
